275. H-Index II: Medium
Q. Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:

        low, high = 0, len(citations)-1
        n = len(citations)-1
        if n < 0:
            return 0
        while low < high:
            
            mid = low + (high-low)//2
            
            if citations[mid] == n-mid+1:
                return n-mid+1
            elif citations[mid] > n-mid+1:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
                
        return n-low if citations[low]==0 else n-low+1
